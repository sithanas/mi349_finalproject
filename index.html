    <h1>The Foods of Consulting</h1>
    <h2>A Tale of Expense Reports (and Creativity)</h2>
    <p class="intro">Consulting involves a lot of travel. Travel involves a lot of food. When the opportunity for food is combined with the ability to expense said food, things get...interesting. Below you will find some of the more interesting dietary discoveries from the road more traveled—no McDonald's pictures here!</p>
    <div class="content">
        <div class="food">
            <h1>Sushi / Sashimi Combo</h1>
            <h2>Palmdale, CA — June 2020</h2>
            <p class="imgcontainer"><a href="images/2020-06-sushi.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/2020-06-sushi.jpg" alt="Sushi and Sashimi Combo Plate"></a>
            <p>Had a pretty decent sushi / sashimi combo platter in California. The rolls were good-not-great—decent, but I've definitely had better, and the same unfortunately goes for the tuna nigiri. The salmon sashimi, however, was excellent—buttery and rich with a nice melt-on-your-tongue finish. Definitely worth the expense report.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="food">
            <h1>King-Sized King Crab</h1>
            <h2>Anchorage, AK — September 2019</h2>
            <p class="imgcontainer"><a href="images/2019-09-crab.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/2019-09-crab.jpg" alt="Giant King Crab Leg"></a>
            <p>When a sales dinner offers you the opportunity to order a two-pound king crab leg you absolutely do not say no. Complete with garlic mashed potatoes, green beans (so you can say you ate something healthy I guess?), and an entire cup of warm drawn butter. Also seen: giant hunk of steak (left) and halibut cheeks (right). Highly recommended—I'd even spend my own money on this if I had to, though after seeing the bill I'm glad I didn't have to.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="food">
            <h1>Alaska-Sized Shade</h1>
            <h2>Anchorage, AK — September 2019</h2>
            <p class="imgcontainer"><a href="images/2019-09-alaskashade.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/2019-09-alaskashade.jpg" alt="Alaska throwing shade at Texas"></a>
            <p>No food on this one—just Alaska reminding everyone who the real biggest state is. I did have the halibut order though (the Texas-sized one) and can attest to it being pretty damn good.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="food">
            <h1>Dim Sum Assortment</h1>
            <h2>San Francisco, CA — August 2019</h2>
            <p class="imgcontainer"><a href="images/2019-08-dimsum.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/2019-08-dimsum.jpg" alt="Soup Dumplings - Dim Sum"></a>
            <p>When you end up in the Bay Area, you take the opportunity to get some excellent Chinese food—so dim sum it is! Soup dumplings to start, followed by everything else we could get our hands on—and done properly, too, with the food brought around on carts. Don't forget the chili oil!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="food">
            <h1>Burger Done Right</h1>
            <h2>Bellevue, NE — May 2019</h2>
            <p class="imgcontainer"><a href="images/2019-05-burger.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/2019-05-burger.jpg" alt="Gourmet Burger, Simple Setting"></a>
            <p>Generic burgers are a dime a dozen, but truly well prepared patties are something special. This burger had an extra element—a topping of pastrami over the patty. Also your eyes are correct—there's no plate in this picture. They serve the burgers right on the napkin!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="food">
            <h1>Airport Udon</h1>
            <h2>Minneapolis, MN — April 2019</h2>
            <p class="imgcontainer"><a href="images/2019-04-udon.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/2019-04-udon.jpg" alt="Udon Noodle Soup"></a>
            <p>One of the hidden gems of the Minneapolis airport is an excellent Asian restaurant tucked in a hallway near the G terminals. Their sushi is decent, but their real specialties are their noodle dishes—including this excellent udon noodle soup. Definitely check it out on your next long layover.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="food">
            <h1>Skylounge Life</h1>
            <h2>Yet Another Airport — March 2019</h2>
            <p class="imgcontainer"><a href="images/2019-03-skylounge.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/2019-03-skylounge.jpg" alt="Desk Setup in a Skylounge"></a>
            <p>No food here—just a quick picture of what it's like to work out of a skylounge during yet another layover. I could not for the life of me tell you which airport this was—they all blur together at a certain port, and every Delta lounge looks like every other Delta lounge—at least in the business center area.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="food">
            <h1>Bulgogi Hot Pots</h1>
            <h2>Minneapolis, MN — March 2019</h2>
            <p class="imgcontainer"><a href="images/2019-03-bulgogi.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/2019-03-bulgogi.jpg" alt="Bulgogi Hot Pots"></a>
            <p>Tried out a new lounge in the Minneapolis airport and found these adorable individual-sized bulgogis. Pretty decent as it turned out—it didn't last long enough to get a photo of the dish itself!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="food">
            <h1>Sky Salad</h1>
            <h2>Up In The Air — February 2019</h2>
            <p class="imgcontainer"><a href="images/2019-02-skysalad.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/2019-02-skysalad.jpg" alt="Delta Chicken Noodle Salad"></a>
            <p>This is a decent example of one of the better dishes you can get if / when you get upgraded to First on a Delta flight—a cold chicken noodle salad with a pretty solid cookie for dessert. Delta regional jets can't serve hot food (no oven in the galley) so you get salads or sandwiches, and this salad was pretty good—not restaurant quality, but defintiely an improvement over the bag of pretzels. (I still grabbed the Biscoff though—never gonna pass those up!)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="food">
            <h1>Pheasant Casserole</h1>
            <h2>Kettering, England — January 2018</h2>
            <p class="imgcontainer"><a href="images/2018-01-pheasant.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/2018-01-pheasant.jpg" alt="Pheasant Casserole"></a>
            <p>When your English hotel has pheasant casserole on the menu, you try pheasant casserole for dinner. Pretty good—flavors were solid, the presentation was excellent, but as it would turn out you can shoot game animals and then serve them in restaurants in the UK—picking lead shot out of the dish was a little bit of a turn-off.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="food">
            <h1>Pigeon Hearts (and Livers) on Toast</h1>
            <h2>Molesworth, England — January 2018</h2>
            <p class="imgcontainer"><a href="images/2018-01-hearts.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/2018-01-hearts.jpg" alt="Pigeon Hearts and Livers with Lentils on Toast"></a>
            <p>Yes, you absolutely read that right—this was an appetizer at one of the stranger restaurants I've ever been to. The dish was "Pigeon Hearts and Livers with Lentils on Toast" and we had to try it—because when else are you going to have an opportunity to eat pigeon? They were very chewy. I'd also like to take a moment to point out how many hearts are on this plate—let's pause and have a moment of silence for the minimum of 8 pigeons that died to make this dish possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="food">
            <h1>Scallops and Black Pudding</h1>
            <h2>Molesworth, England — January 2018</h2>
            <p class="imgcontainer"><a href="images/2018-01-blackpudding.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/2018-01-blackpudding.jpg" alt="Scallops and Black Pudding Appetizer"></a>
            <p>Pretty delicious appetizer—the soft texture of the scallops went well with the crisped black pudding. Admittedly, those of you who know what black pudding is may not especially like the dish—but if you don't mind the idea of eating what is effectively congealed blood, you'll find this to be quite delicious. As a fan of black sausage, I didn't mind one bit.</p>
